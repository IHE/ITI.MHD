The Mobile access to Health Documents (MHD) Profile defines one standardized interface to 
health documents (a.k.a., an Application Programming Interface (API)) for use by mobile devices 
so that deployment of mobile applications is more consistent and reusable. 
The transactions defined here leverage the document content- and format-agnostic metadata concepts 
from XDS but simplify them for access in constrained environments including mobile devices. 

MHD is part of [IHE](https://profiles.ihe.net) -- [IT-Infrastructure](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI) Domain and 
part of the [IHE Document Sharing Health Information Exchange](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper) solution.
