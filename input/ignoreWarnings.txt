# IG publisher caused warning. Grahame indicates we should ignore for now https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/New.20ConceptMap.20Warning.20--.20induced.20by.20IG.20Publisher
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version {3} is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)

# The concept map is from a conceptual valueset from IHE, so there is no formal definition. not a problem the source checking isn't done
The Source Code System urn:ihe:iti:2007:AssociationType is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# The concept map is from EB-Registry defined values, so we are using rfc3986. not a problem the source checking isn't done
The Source Code System urn:ietf:rfc:3986 is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

# some examples are underpopulated, the full population is not important for the use-case being explained
