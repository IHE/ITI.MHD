The Source Code System urn:ihe:iti:2007:AssociationType is not fully defined and populated, and no sourceScope is specified, so the source code checking will not be performed

The IG is not for the international realm, and it uses SNOMED CT, so it should fix the SCT edition in the expansion parameters
