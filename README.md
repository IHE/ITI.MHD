# ITI.MHD 

This **branch** IG is founded on HL7 FHIR R5. This [MHD IG is made available](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/5.0.0-comment) for use, but is not the recommended version of MHD or FHIR. The family of [Document Sharing Health Information Exchange](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html) Implementation Guides have not been converted to FHIR R5, and there are fewer implementations of FHIR R5. This FHIR R5 founded MHD is derived from the FHIR R4 MHD which is the main focus. Current MHD is founded on FHIR R4 to support the broadest availability, it is available at [https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/index.html).


This GITHUB repository is the source content for the [MHD publication](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/) by ITI Technical committee. 

The Mobile access to Health Documents (MHD) Profile defines one standardized interface to 
health documents (a.k.a., an Application Programming Interface (API)) for use by mobile devices 
so that deployment of mobile applications is more consistent and reusable. 
The transactions defined here leverage the document content- and format-agnostic metadata concepts 
from XDS but simplify them for access in constrained environments including mobile devices.
