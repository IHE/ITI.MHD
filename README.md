# ITI.MHD 
this GITHUB repository is under development by ITI Technical committee. 

The Mobile access to Health Documents (MHD) Profile defines one standardized interface to 
health documents (a.k.a., an Application Programming Interface (API)) for use by mobile devices 
so that deployment of mobile applications is more consistent and reusable. 
The transactions defined here leverage the document content- and format-agnostic metadata concepts 
from XDS but simplify them for access in constrained environments including mobile devices. 

This IG has changed from the use of DocumentManifest Resource to use of the List Resource for both SubmissionSet and Folder.
 
The IHE MHD Profile text is Normative, this IG publication is Informative. 
After public comment resolution this Implementation Guide will become the normative specification for MHD.

This Continuous Build will appear http://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/ITI.MHD/branches/master/index.html
